\maketitle

% There are two main approached: model-based and data-drive 
Research in Artificial Intelligence is torn between two general approach: the traditional AI approach that assume a model of the world is given and {\bf reasons} about it, and the data-driven AI approach that builds on the growing availability of historical data and {\bf learns} from it how to handle future events. For example, classical planning algorithms 
employ a model-based approach through the well-known ``frame axiom'' assumed by STRIPS planners. In contrast, popular re-enforcement learning algorithm do not even try to model the environment, and learn directly how to act. Both approaches -- model-based and data-driven -- have pros and cons and are suited for different settings. 
%In general, one can say that the model-based approaches are often more principled and allow stronger claims about the performance of the underlying algorithms (e.g., optimality). However, as countless applications have discovered, having an accurate model of the world is very difficult. These are not needed by data-driven methods, which are also often much faster than the model-based methods. 



% Data driven is not always great, and model-based is not always great. Here lays the challenge
%Clearly, if there is no a-priori knowledge about the world model then data-driven methods are needed. On the other hand, if an accurate model of the world is available then it is wasteful to ignore it. Moreover, model-based approach provide strong theoretical guarantees in terms of completeness and solution quality (e.g., optimality) that can be difficult, if not impossible, to provide without a formal model of the world. 


% We aim for the middle ground
% Our goal: when to use which and why
It is the aim of this proposal to study how to combine model-based and data-driven approaches in cases where an approximate model of the world is given along with observed data. Concretely, we focus on three classical AI tasks: automated planning, model-based diagnosis, and plan recognition. Both model-based and data-driven methods were proposed for these tasks, including in prior work of the PIs. 
For each of these fundamental AI problems we will develop algorithms and theory for using both sources of information --  a given approximate model and observed data -- in a principled way.
