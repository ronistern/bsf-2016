% 1. From BSF guidelines: A brief description of the subject and the scientific and technological background;


The contributions of the proposed research go far beyond creating better algorithms for diagnosis, planning, and plan recognition.  By studying and understanding the effect of having an approximate model on the theoretical limits of what can be learned from data, 
and what needs to be supplied by the approximate model, one can impact the efforts used to generate such approximate models in a more informed way. For example, if some aspect of the world is especially difficult to learn, then it makes sense to divert expert efforts in modelling it, while if other parts are easier to learn then expert costs can be saved. Since modeling the worlds is notoriously difficult, choosing what not to model is key in practical applications of AI. 
Moreover, we show that one may actually choose to ignore a given model 
if sufficient data is available, in order to speedup the reasoning process.
