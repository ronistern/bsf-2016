% BSF Instructions:
%This file should include the words 'Broader Impacts Statement' in the heading. The following information should be included: the full title of the proposed application, which should be brief, meaningful and suitable for use in the general media; the application number supplied by the system; and the names and affiliations of the principal investigators.
%An impact statement of about 250 words or less is required. Please address the broader impact and importance (social and/or economic and/or scientific value) of the proposed research.

While in the proposed research we will focus on two specific problems -- planning and diagnosis -- the impact is expected to be much wider. 

First, model-based and data-driven methods have been used to a much wider range of problems, such as plan recognition, coordination of multi-agent systems, and scheduling. We expect that the foundations we will establish in the proposed research for integrating model and observations will carry over to other tasks. 


Second, the PAC search framework we will develop will open up the field of heuristic search to the notion of probabilistic guarantees, which will allow search algorithms in general to scale to much larger problems while still preserving a useful notion of solution quality. 

Third, by studying and understanding the effect of having a partial model on the theoretical limits of what can be learned from data, one can decide the cost-effectiveness of generating such a model. 
This is especially improtant since modeling the world is notoriously difficult, and choosing what not to model is key in practical applications of AI. 

Lastly, most funds are requested to support graduate students, reflecting our focus on education and our commitment to training the next generation of researchers.
